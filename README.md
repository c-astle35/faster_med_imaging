# faster_med_imaging
Collective attemtps at faster biomedical imaging reconstruction.

### Current Times of Functions (Using CPU)
- fastRadon.py:
  + Radon Transform: ~
  + Back Projection: ~

- Radon_projection.py

### Current Resources Being Used:
- Example Code of Using Numba and Dask to Compute Pi: https://gist.github.com/jhidding/e08c3096b5c54bf2138ca248625de029
- Dask Documentation: https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/
- Numba Documentation (General): http://numba.pydata.org/
- Numba for CUDA GPUs: https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/index.html
- CUDA C Programming Guide: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/
- Matthew Rocklin's Blog (One of the Lead Builders and Maintainers of Dask): http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/
- Numpy for MATLAB Users: http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html
- Saving Lives: The Mathematics of Tomography: https://plus.maths.org/content/saving-lives-mathematics-tomography

### Plans
- Convert the rest of the Matlab code which was found in these two presentations: https://www.msri.org/people/20822
- Further explain the Radon transform and back projection
